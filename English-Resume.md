## 🎯 About Me

A DevOps Engineer with over 8 years of hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining software infrastructure at enterprise scale. Possess deep knowledge of continuous delivery, intelligent automation, and complex systems architecture with a strong focus on high availability and service reliability.  
I’ve played a key role in building and optimizing development and deployment pipelines—from infrastructure architecture and clustering to creating secure, flexible, and monitorable ecosystems.  
With a passion for learning and optimization, I act as a bridge between development and infrastructure teams to reduce human error, accelerate software delivery cycles, and ensure service continuity in sensitive production environments.  
To me, DevOps is not just about tools—it's a principled approach to building reliable, scalable systems tailored to real business needs.
